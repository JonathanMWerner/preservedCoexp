Description: This package allows users to explore the preserved co-expression of genes from their single-cell RNA-seq data using a fetal brain reference co-expression network. It provides a meta-analytic co-expression network derived from fetal brain single-cell RNAseq datasets and functions for users to generate co-expression networks of their own single-cell RNAseq datasets. Users can quantify the strength of preserved co-expression between their data and our meta-analytic co-expression network for individual genes or genesets. We provide functions to quantify the preserved co-expression of our meta-analytically derived fetal cell-type markers as well as GO terms.
